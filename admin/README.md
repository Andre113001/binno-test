## localhost

> Contact the collaborators to ask for a ".env" file.

To start a localhost instance of the server, type...

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

to utilize [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) which automatically restarts
the Node.js application when changes to files in the directory are detected.
